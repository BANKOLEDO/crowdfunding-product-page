## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

While working on this project, I learned how to:

- Implement dynamic UI features like modal dialogs and progress bars.
- Handle user interactions effectively to update the state of the application.
- Utilize CSS Grid and Flexbox to create responsive layouts.

Here’s a snippet of code I’m particularly proud of:

```html
<h1>Responsive Modal Implementation</h1>
```
```css
.modal {
  display: block;
  /* Other styles */
}
```
```js
const updateProgressBar = (pledgeAmount) => {
  // Update progress bar logic
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I plan to focus on:

- Improving accessibility and ensuring cross-browser compatibility.
- Enhancing performance with optimized code and assets.
- Exploring advanced React features like Hooks and Context API.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) - Helpful for learning CSS Grid and Flexbox techniques.
